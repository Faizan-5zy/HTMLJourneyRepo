# Semantic Elements in HTML

HTML5 introduced semantic elements, which are tags that provide more meaning to both developers and browsers about the structure and content of a web page. Semantic elements enhance the readability, accessibility, and search engine optimization of the page.
List of Semantic Elements:

    <article>: Represents an independent piece of content that can be distributed and reused.

    <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.

    <details>: Represents a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional information.

    <figcaption>: Represents a caption or legend for a <figure> element.

    <figure>: Represents any content that is referenced from the main content, often used for images, charts, etc.

    <footer>: Represents the footer of a section or page.

    <header>: Represents the header of a section or page.

    <main>: Represents the main content of the document.

    <mark>: Represents text highlighted for reference or notation purposes.

    <nav>: Represents a navigation menu.

    <section>: Represents a generic section of a document or application.

    <summary>: Represents a summary, caption, or legend for a <details> element.

    <time>: Represents a specific period in time.

## Usage:

Replace generic container elements like `<div>` and `<span>` with these semantic elements where applicable to provide better meaning to your HTML structure.By incorporating semantic elements, you enhance the structure and meaning of your HTML, making it more accessible and understandable for developers and browsers alike.
