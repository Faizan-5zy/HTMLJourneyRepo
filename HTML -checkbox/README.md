# HTML Checkbox

This HTML file showcases the usage of checkboxes for various clothing items. Each checkbox is accompanied by a label, providing a clear representation of different options. The checkboxes are included within a simple form.   

     <form>: Represents an HTML form.
            <input type="checkbox">: Creates a checkbox input for the item "KURTHI."
            <input type="checkbox">: Creates another checkbox for the item "JEANS."
            <input type="checkbox">: Creates a checkbox for the item "active top."
            <input type="checkbox">: Creates a checkbox for the item "casual top."

## Key Points:
Each `<input>` tag with type="checkbox" represents a checkbox.The text following each checkbox is not enclosed in any specific HTML tag, so it will appear as plain text next to the checkbox. Checkboxes for clothing items like kurti, jeans, active top, and casual top. Organized within a form for logical structure.
