## Additional Notes

    <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />:
        Specifies the type of Twitter Card. In this case, it's set to "summary," which means it will display a summary card.

    <meta name="twitter:site" content="@flickr" />:
        Specifies the Twitter username of the site (e.g., "@flickr").

    <meta name="twitter:title" content="Small Island Developing States Photo Submission" />:
        Specifies the title of the content to be shared on Twitter.

    <meta name="twitter:description" content="View the album on Flickr." />:

When someone shares a link to this HTML page on Twitter, Twitter will use the information from these meta tags to create a card with a title, description, and image preview.
