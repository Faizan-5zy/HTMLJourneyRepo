# HTML Text Area Readme  

This HTML file demonstrates the usage of the `<textarea>` and `<input>` elements. Below is an explanation of each part of the code:

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration:**
   - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.

2. **HTML Structure:**
   - `<html lang="en">`: The root element of the HTML document, specifying the language as English.

3. **Head Section:**
   - `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.
   - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Sets the character set to UTF-8 for proper text encoding.
   - `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">`: Ensures the latest version of Internet Explorer is used.
   - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Configures the viewport for responsive design.
   - `<title>HTML Text Area </title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document.

4. **Body Section:**
   - `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.
   - `<textarea rows="20" cols="50">Hello...</textarea>`: Creates a text area with 20 rows and 50 columns. The default text is "Hello...".
   - `<input type="image" src="" width="20" height="40">`: Defines an image input with a source, width, and height attributes.

**How to Use:**
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The page will display a textarea with "Hello..." and an image input.
3. Feel free to modify the content within the `<textarea>` or provide a valid image source for the `<input>`.

**Note:**
- Adjust the content, rows, cols, source, width, and height attributes as needed.
- Ensure the image source is valid for the `<input>` element.

This simple HTML file serves as a starting point for creating forms with text areas and image inputs.
