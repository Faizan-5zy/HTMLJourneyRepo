# Image Map Example

This example demonstrates how to create an image map in HTML, allowing you to define clickable areas on an image that lead to different URLs or trigger specific actions.

## How to Use

1. Replace `"your-image.jpg"` in the `<img>` tag with the actual path to your image file.

2. Update the `<area>` elements within the `<map>` tag to define the clickable areas on the image. Adjust the `shape` attribute to determine the shape of the clickable area (rect, circle, poly), and set the `coords` attribute to specify the coordinates.

3. Modify the `href` attributes of the `<area>` elements to define the URLs to navigate to when the corresponding areas are clicked.

4. Open the HTML file in a web browser to interact with the image map.
