Personal Profile HTML Template
This HTML template provides a basic structure for creating a personal profile web page. Below is a brief overview of the different sections and functionalities covered in this code:

1. Document Structure
The document begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, specifying the HTML5 document type.
The <html> element defines the root of the HTML document and includes the language attribute set to English.
2. Metadata and Title
Meta tags in the <head> section specify the character encoding, compatibility settings, and viewport configuration for responsiveness.
The <title> tag sets the title of the web page displayed on the browser tab.
3. Profile Information
The page displays the person's name (<h1> tag) and an image (<img> tag) with an alternative text for accessibility.
4. About Me Section
The <h2> heading introduces the "About me" section, followed by a <div> with placeholder text describing the person.
5. Education Details
The <h2> heading signifies the "Education Details" section, which includes a table displaying educational qualifications, institutions, and marks.
6. Address
Another <h2> heading indicates the "Address" section, followed by a <div> with placeholder text for the person's address.
7. Contact Form
The "Contact Me" section starts with an <h2> heading.
A <form> is provided with various input fields for user input, including name, date of birth, gender (male/female), phone number, email, rating (using a range input), feedback (file input), username, password, and a checkbox for confirming that the user is not a robot.
The form also includes "Reset" and "Submit now" buttons (<input> elements) for user interaction.
How to Use:
You can modify the content inside the <div> elements to reflect your personal information.
Customize the form fields according to your requirements, and you can handle the form submission using server-side scripts if needed.
Optionally, you can style the HTML elements using CSS to enhance the visual presentation of the page.
