# Unordered List HTML Example

This is a simple HTML document demonstrating the usage of unordered lists. Unordered lists are used to represent a collection of items where the order of items does not matter. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet point.

## List Items

- **Coffee:** Represents the first item in the list.
- **Tie:** Represents the second item in the list.
- **Water:** Represents the third item in the list.
- **Coffee Variations:**
  - **Hot Coffee:** A sub-item representing a variation of coffee.
  - **Cold Coffee:** Another sub-item representing a different variation of coffee.

## How to Use

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the unordered list displayed. The HTML code for the list can be found within the `<body>` section of the `index.html` file.
