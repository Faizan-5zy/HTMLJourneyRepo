# Embedding YouTube Video
The code in index.html demonstrates how to embed a YouTube video on a web page using an <iframe> element. You can customize the video by modifying the src attribute of the <iframe> tag. Replace the URL inside the src attribute with the YouTube video URL you want to embed.

`<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aE58wbXdqU" title="YouTube video player" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>`

## Customization Options
### Width and Height:
You can adjust the width and height attributes of the <iframe> to change the dimensions of the embedded video player.
### URL Modification:
To embed a different YouTube video, replace the URL inside the src attribute with the desired video URL.

## Additional Instructions (Optional)
The README also provides optional instructions for additional customizations:
Starting the Video at a Specific Time: You can start the video at a specific time by appending ?start=XXs to the video URL, where XX represents the number of seconds.

## Example:
To start the video at 30 seconds, use ?start=30s.
Showing Player Controls: By default, the video player controls are displayed. If you want to hide the controls, remove the controls attribute from the <iframe> tag
