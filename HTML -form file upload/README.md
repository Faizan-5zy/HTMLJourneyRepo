# Form File Upload Readme

This simple HTML file provides a basic structure for implementing a form file upload feature.

## Usage

1. **Structure**: The HTML file is structured with a `<form>` element to handle the file upload. The form has an action attribute (`/upload`) that should be replaced with the actual server endpoint for file handling.

2. **File Input**: The file input field (`<input type="file" multiple>`) allows users to select one or multiple files for upload.

3. **Label for Accessibility**: The `<label>` element is associated with the file input through the `for` attribute, enhancing accessibility. Users can click the label to open the file picker.

4. **Submit Button**: The submit button (`<button type="submit">Upload</button>`) triggers the form submission.

## Important Note

- This HTML file provides the front-end structure for file upload. You need to implement server-side code to handle file processing on the server.

- Update the `action` attribute of the form with the appropriate server endpoint.
