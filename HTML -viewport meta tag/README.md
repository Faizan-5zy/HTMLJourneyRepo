# HTML Viewport Meta Tag

This repository provides a basic HTML template with the viewport meta tag. The viewport meta tag is essential for controlling the layout and scale on different devices.

## Meta Tag Explanation

- The `<meta>` tag with `name="viewport"` is used to control the viewport settings.
- `width=device-width` ensures that the width of the viewport matches the device's screen width.
- `initial-scale=1` sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
