# Right-to-Left Website

This repository contains a simple HTML file that demonstrates the creation of a right-to-left (RTL) website. This can be particularly useful for languages that are written from right to left, such as Arabic and Hebrew.

## HTML Structure

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- The `<html dir="rtl">` tag sets the base direction of the text to right-to-left.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata about the document, including the title.
- The `<body>` section contains the actual content of the page, and the sample text is written in the Lorem Ipsum placeholder text.
