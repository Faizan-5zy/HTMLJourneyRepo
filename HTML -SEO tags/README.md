## SEO Tags Explanation

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Declares the character encoding for the document, ensuring that it is interpreted as UTF-8, which is a widely used character encoding.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Specifies the viewport settings for responsive web design. It ensures that the page adapts well to various device screen sizes.

- `<title>Home Page</title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document, which is displayed on the browser tab or window.

- `<meta name="description" content="This is a page about new cars">`: Provides a brief description of the page's content. Search engines often use this description in search results.

- `<meta name="keywords" content="new cars">`: Although the use of meta keywords is less significant in modern SEO, it traditionally specified keywords relevant to the page's content.

- `<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/car.html">`: Defines the canonical URL for the page. It helps search engines understand the preferred version of a page in cases where multiple URLs might lead to the same content.

- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`: Directs search engine robots on how to handle the page. In this case, it instructs them to index the content and follow the links.

- The `<body>` section is left empty, as it's meant to contain the actual content of your webpage.
