## Structural Tags:
###`<header>`:
Represents a container for introductory content, typically containing headings and logos.
###`<nav>`:
Defines a container for navigation links.
###`<div>`:
General-purpose container for grouping and styling elements.
###`<main>`:
Contains the central content of the webpage.
###`<aside>`:
Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
###`<footer>`:
Contains metadata or authorship information about the document, often including copyright notices.

The code creates a basic webpage structure with a header, navigation, main content area, sidebar, and footer. Texts like "Ismail Faizan," "Navigation," "About me," and "Main Content" are placeholders and can be replaced with actual content. The images and additional styling and interactivity can be added using CSS and JavaScript, respectively.
